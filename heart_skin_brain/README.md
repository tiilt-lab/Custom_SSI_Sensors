# Heart, Brainwave, and Skin Conductance Sensors

A Variety of physiological sensors to be used with [SSI](https://github.com/hcmlab/ssi). Sensors include the following:

  * GSR (Galvanic Skin Response)
    * Refers to changes in sweat gland activity that are reflective of the intensity of our emotional state, otherwise known as emotional arousal.
  * PPG (Photoplethysmography LED Pulse Sensor)
    * Uses a light-based technology to sense the rate of blood flow as controlled by the heartâ€™s pumping action
  * ECG (Electrocardiography)
    * Measures  the bio-potential generated by electrical signals that control the expansion and contraction of heart chambers
  * EEG (Electroencephalography)
    * An electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain.
  * EEG Combined with one of the following: (PPG, ECG, GSR)
